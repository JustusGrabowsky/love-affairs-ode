# Romantic Dynamics

## An Investigation into Emotional Instability

This is an exploration of a model for the **Dynamics of Relationships**. We use systems of differential equations to predict how two individuals' feelings for each other evolve over time, assuming certain behaviors. While in reality stability in relationships is determined by a range of factors, e.g. good communication, here, it is governed by the eigenvalues of the system matrix.

I tried to vizualize the results in an insightful and entertainig way.

Inspired by Strogatz' *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*, Chapter 5.3.
